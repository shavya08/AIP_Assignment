AIP Assignment - Customer Churn Prediction using ML
Background:
You are working for an analytics consultancy company. A mid-size private bank, “World Plus”, requested you to deliver a pitch to win a major contract with them to develop and deploy a lead prediction system.

Lead conversion plays an important role in the success of any banking operation; involving the identification and targeting of prospective customers who are most likely to convert (purchase a product or service). World Plus provides a range of banking products, including loans, investment options, savings accounts, and credit products. They employ various communication channels such as call centres, live chat, email, and social media to effectively sell these products to their existing customers.

World Plus faces challenges in accurately identifying leads. They aim to implement a lead prediction system to pinpoint prospective customers who will convert and buy their new term deposit product. Through this system, they can strategically target these prospective customers via their communication channels and avoid unnecessary expenses on uninterested customers. This is particularly important because sales and marketing operations are costly in terms of both time and money. Several other consultancy companies have been approached as well, and the final decision on who will get the contract will largely depend on the outcome of a demonstration of the data mining approach to this problem based on a dataset that World Plus provided.

The dataset1 contains 220,000 records of historic customer data (that collected during a previous product offering).

1 The data has been adapted from Analytics Vidhya: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/all/

Instructions:
Please read the instructions carefully and discuss with your colleagues and provide an outline of your approach.

[30 marks] Each team member should choose and review exactly one academic paper per member that is related to the data mining project. For instance, the paper can be related to one of the machine learning techniques or data preparation methods used in the project. Within a team, no two members should review the same paper. In your report, provide a brief discussion of these papers including the key ideas obtained from the papers. You are not expected to convey a full understanding of these papers; instead, the aim is to start working with academic literature. However, a justification should be given as to why you selected your chosen papers, and whether/how they may have influenced your data mining project.

[40 marks] Conduct data mining on the provided data to identify a suitable approach for predicting leads (customers) who will convert and buy the new term deposit. Outline your approach considering the steps in CRISP-DM methodology and justify the selected methods for data preparation, modelling and evaluation steps used in this project.

You do not need to provide every detailed step in the report, instead, focus on the big picture and justifications of the chosen approach and the chosen performance measures. The focus of this assignment is to give you a go at thinking about the business problem, data preparation for modelling, implementing and interpreting several models using real data, describing your approach to the data mining project clearly and providing clear justification of the steps followed and the methods used. A working R Markdown file (or R script) should be submitted as well (of course without the data file).

[30 marks] These final marks are awarded for the sales pitch, where we will evaluate presentation style, content, managerial insights, media, and appropriateness for the audience and generally how convincing your presentation is. There is no single correct approach to this assignment; the focus is on demonstrating proper management of a realistic analytics project using the CRISP-DM methodology and that you can extract
and suitably present managerial insights to your client.
